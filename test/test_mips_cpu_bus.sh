# ./test_mips_cpu_bus.sh [cpu file directory] [instruction]
#   to test a single instruction
# ./test_mips_cpu_bus.sh [cpu file directory]
#   to test all instructions

# Things to do:
# 1. Replace templates with actual file names [tick]
# 2. Complete the test bench verilog file [tick]
# 3. Check if syntax is correct for this bash script file since DT's file uses
#     different syntax which doesn't work here (if statements)
#     UPDATE : if statements are actually the same apart from a ; at the end
#     of fi. Also other syntax differences turned out that we could actually use DT's
# 4. Adjust files to be able to handle the changes in directories
# 5. Move testing all instructions into one for loop [tick]
# 6. Recover early exit code in section 3 when the CPU is fully functional
# 7. Adjust directory and script to compile every verilog file in the mips_cpu
#     folder [tick]
# 8. Send relative outputs from running the script to stderr rather than stdout
#     This means things like the output of diff [tick]
# 9. Might need a stderr output on the compile line (update based on the Friday sanity check) [not needed]
# 10. Ensure all instructions have a test case with the _0 suffix [tick]
# 11. Fix unsigned output for the link instructions [tick]
# 12. Fix test-case output for when the instruction == and, repeatedely outputting
#   andi_0 and Pass etc. [tick]

# Possible future improvements
# 1. The for loop going through each instruction test case could be summarised
#   into one for loop and have everything related to it in that single for loop
#   rather than have multiple for loops
#       This avoids having to call the same TESTNAME=$(basename ${i} .asm.txt) lines
#       at every loop [tick]

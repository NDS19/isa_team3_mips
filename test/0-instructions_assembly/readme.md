0-input_instructions_assembly

This folder contains all of the test inputs for each instruction.

Each test input needs the suffix .asm.txt

Each file name is the lowercase MIPS name to allow the testbench script to
find the needed instruction test-cases without complications. Also requires
less computational power since the input in the command-line is a lower-case
instruction word

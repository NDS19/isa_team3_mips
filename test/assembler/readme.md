This directory contains the custom-built assembler used to convert the MIPS
instruction lines to hex assembly code which the CPU interprets and performs
tasks from.

- To use the assembler run "python3 Assembler.py"
- Next enter the name of the file to be assembled
- The assembler will then output the hex
- An example of how to do this in the shell is with this command "echo test.txt | python3 Assembler.py > hex.txt"
- Test.txt has example assembly code.
